In this project, I have written two PHP scrips login.php and board.php. The login.php script generates a form that has two text windows for username and password and a "Login" button. The board.php has a "Logout" button, a text area to write a message, a "New Post" button, and a list of messages. The board script prints all the messages in the database as a flat list ordered by date/time. For each posted message, it prints:
The message ID.
The username and the fullname of the person who posted the message.
The date and time when this message was posted.
If this is a reply to a message, the ID of this message.
The message text.
A button "Reply" to reply to this message.
